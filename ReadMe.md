# Project Waze Churn Prediction

## Introduction

Wazeâ€™s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers worldwide to reach their destinations. Supported by a vibrant community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users, Waze aims to enhance every drive, making it safer and more efficient. As part of a broader initiative to boost growth and user retention, this project focuses on predicting user churn using historical data.

High retention rates are typically indicative of satisfied users who continue to utilize the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will enable Waze to identify users at risk of leaving, allowing for targeted interventions to maintain engagement and satisfaction. By proactively addressing potential churn, Waze can improve user retention and foster business growth.

The dataset used for this project comprises 14,999 rows, each representing a unique user, and 13 columns detailing various aspects of user activity and engagement. The primary objective is to analyze this data, develop a predictive model for churn, and derive actionable insights to enhance user retention strategies.

## Class Walkthrough on EDA and Interacting with the Data

### Waze Project EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the first step in understanding the data and its underlying patterns. During this phase, various techniques are employed to gain insights into the data distribution, relationships between features, and potential outliers or anomalies.

Key activities during the EDA include:
- **Data Visualization**: Plotting data to visualize distributions, correlations, and trends.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Summarizing key statistics for each feature to understand their impact on churn.
- **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing or inconsistent data.

### Plotting

Visualization plays a crucial role in this project. It helps in:
- **Understanding Feature Relationships**: Plotting scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to explore relationships between features.
- **Churn Analysis**: Visualizing the distribution of churned versus retained users across different features.
- **Feature Importance**: Using visual tools like bar charts or heatmaps to identify the most influential features for predicting churn.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that better represent the underlying patterns in the data. This process includes:
- **Creating New Features**: Deriving new features from existing ones to improve the model's predictive power.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying and selecting the most relevant features to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.
- **Scaling and Encoding**: Standardizing and encoding features to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

## Conclusion

The Waze Churn Prediction project is a critical component of Waze's strategy to enhance user retention. By leveraging the insights gained from EDA, plotting, and feature engineering, a predictive model can be developed to identify users at risk of churning. The actionable insights derived from this analysis will enable Waze to implement targeted interventions, ultimately leading to higher retention rates and continued growth for the Waze app.
